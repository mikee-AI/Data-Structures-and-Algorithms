Brute Force Algorithm

A brute force algorithm simply tries all possibilities until a satisfactory solution is found
Such an algorithm can be:
Optimizing: Find the best solution. This may require finding all solutions, or if a value for the best solution is known, it may stop when any best solution is found
Example: Finding the best path for a travelling salesman
Satisficing: Stop as soon as a solution is found that is good enough
Example: Finding a travelling salesman path that is within 10% of optimal

Often, brute force algorithms require exponential time
Various heuristics and optimizations can be used
Heuristic: A “rule of thumb” that helps you decide which possibilities to look at first
Optimization: In this case, a way to eliminate certain possibilites without fully exploring them
