Simple Recursive Algorithm

A simple recursive algorithm:
Solves the base cases directly
Recurs with a simpler subproblem
Does some extra work to convert the solution to the simpler subproblem into a solution to the given problem
I call these “simple” because several of the other algorithm types are inherently recursive



Examples of Simple Recursive Algorithms

To count the number of elements in a list:
If the list is empty, return zero; otherwise,
Step past the first element, and count the remaining elements in the list
Add one to the result
To test if a value occurs in a list:
If the list is empty, return false; otherwise,
If the first thing in the list is the given value, return true; otherwise
Step past the first element, and test whether the value occurs in the remainder of the list
