Branch and Bound Algorithm

Branch and bound algorithms are generally used for optimization problems
As the algorithm progresses, a tree of subproblems is formed
The original problem is considered the “root problem”
A method is used to construct an upper and lower bound for a given problem
At each node, apply the bounding methods
If the bounds match, it is deemed a feasible solution to that particular subproblem
If bounds do not match, partition the problem represented by that node, and make the two subproblems into children nodes
Continue, using the best known feasible solution to trim sections of the tree, until all nodes have been solved or trimmed

Example branch and bound algorithm

Travelling salesman problem: A salesman has to visit each of n cities (at least) once each, and wants to minimize total distance travelled
Consider the root problem to be the problem of finding the shortest route through a set of cities visiting each city once
Split the node into two child problems:
Shortest route visiting city A first
Shortest route not visiting city A first
Continue subdividing similarly as the tree grows
