Backtracking Algorithm

Backtracking algorithms are based on a depth-first recursive search
A backtracking algorithm:
Tests to see if a solution has been found, and if so, returns it; otherwise
For each choice that can be made at this point,
Make that choice
Recur
If the recursion returns a solution, return it
If no choices remain, return failure

To color a map with no more than four colors:
color(Country n)
If all countries have been colored (n > number of countries) return success; otherwise,
For each color c of four colors,
If country n is not adjacent to a country that has been colored c
Color country n with color c
recursivly color country n+1
If successful, return success
Return failure (if loop exits)
