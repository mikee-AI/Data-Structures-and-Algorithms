Divide & Conquer Algorithm

A divide and conquer algorithm consists of two parts:
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems of the same type, and solve these subproblems recursively
Combine the solutions to the subproblems into a solution to the original problem
Traditionally, an algorithm is only called divide and conquer if it contains two or more recursive calls



Example of Divide & Conquer Algorithm

Quicksort:
Partition the array into two parts, and quicksort each of the parts
No additional work is required to combine the two sorted parts
Mergesort:
Cut the array in half, and mergesort each half
Combine the two sorted arrays into a single sorted array by merging them
